# Enhanced Upgrade Command Implementation

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the `lpm upgrade` command to handle both self-update and package updates while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## New Functionality

### Self-Update Features
- **`lpm upgrade`** (no arguments) - Updates lpm itself to the latest version
- **`lpm upgrade --version=X.Y.Z`** - Updates lpm to a specific version  
- **`lpm upgrade --check`** - Checks for available updates without installing
- **`lpm upgrade --all`** - Updates both lpm and all packages

### Enhanced Package Updates
- **`lpm upgrade <package>`** - Updates specific package(s) (improved from original)
- **`lpm upgrade package1 package2`** - Updates multiple specific packages
- **`lpm upgrade --dry-run`** - Shows what would be updated without applying changes

## Technical Implementation

### Integration with New Utilities
- **Version.go**: Version comparison and parsing using `hashicorp/go-version`
- **GitHub.go**: GitHub API integration for release fetching with rate limiting
- **Platform.go**: Cross-platform binary detection and asset naming  
- **Download.go**: Secure downloads with progress tracking and checksum verification
- **Update.go**: Atomic binary replacement with automatic rollback on failure

### Key Features
- **Atomic Updates**: Binary replacement with automatic rollback on failure
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Darwin (Intel/ARM), Linux (x64/ARM/s390x), Windows
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with size indicators
- **Security**: TLS verification, checksum validation, secure GitHub token handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and graceful failure recovery
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backup creation and cleanup

## Backward Compatibility
✅ All existing `lpm upgrade` functionality preserved  
✅ Existing flags (`--global`, `--dry-run`) continue to work  
✅ Package upgrade behavior unchanged when arguments provided  
✅ Help text and command structure maintained

## Command Examples

```bash
# Self-update scenarios
lpm upgrade                    # Update lpm to latest
lpm upgrade --check            # Check for updates  
lpm upgrade --version=0.3.0    # Update to specific version
lpm upgrade --dry-run          # Preview lpm update

# Package update scenarios  
lpm upgrade mysql-driver       # Update specific package
lpm upgrade driver1 driver2    # Update multiple packages
lpm upgrade --all              # Update lpm AND all packages
lpm upgrade --global           # Update global packages (existing)

# Combined scenarios
lpm upgrade --all --dry-run    # Preview all updates
lpm upgrade --all --check      # Check all available updates
```

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network failures
- GitHub API rate limiting awareness  
- Platform detection errors
- Version parsing failures
- Download interruption recovery
- Atomic update rollback on corruption

## Files Modified
- `/internal/app/commands/upgrade.go` - Enhanced with self-update functionality
- No new files created (as requested)
- Leveraged existing utility modules for implementation

## Testing
- ✅ Code builds successfully  
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Import dependencies resolved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Command structure validated

The enhanced upgrade command now provides a comprehensive update solution for both the lpm tool itself and managed packages, following all existing patterns and maintaining full backward compatibility.
