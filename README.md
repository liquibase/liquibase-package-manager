## lpm is experimental and not officially supported

lpm is an experimental project. Issues can be reported [here](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-package-manager/issues), but there is no guarantee of support.

## Installation

lpm is distributed as a single binary. Install lpm by downloading, unzipping, and moving it to a directory included in your system's PATH. Releases are available [here](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-package-manager/releases).

## Setup

lpm will make a best effort to locate the location of the liquibase lib directory. It is recommended to set the LIQUIBASE_HOME environment variable.

Examples:

```shell
export LIQUIBASE_HOME=/usr/local/opt/liquibase/libexec
echo  'export LIQUIBASE_HOME=/usr/local/opt/liquibase/libexec' >> ~/.bashrc 
```

## Usage

```shell
lpm <command>
```

### Available Commands

* add
* completion
* dedupe
* help
* install
* list
* remove
* search
* update
* upgrade

## Autocompletion

lpm can generate shell completions for multiple shells. The following shells are available:

### bash

Generate the autocompletion script for lpm for the bash shell.
To load completions in your current shell session:
`source <(lpm completion bash)`

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

* Linux:

```shell
lpm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/lpm
```

* MacOS:

```shell
lpm completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/lpm
```

### zsh

To load completions in your current shell session:
`source <(lpm completion zsh)`

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
`lpm completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_lpm"`

### fish

To load completions in your current shell session:
`lpm completion fish | source`

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
`lpm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/lpm.fish`

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
